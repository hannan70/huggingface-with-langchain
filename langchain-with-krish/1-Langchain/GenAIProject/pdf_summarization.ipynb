Introduction\\nIn a 5G sensor network, a massive amount of data are handled via sensor devices in a\\nlarge area. International Data Corporation (IDC) research states that 70% of companies will\\ndrive to use 1.2 billion devices for the connectivity management solution by 5G services\\nworldwide [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the future of massive connectivity under\\n5G sensor networks. Currently, the IoT is performing a vital role in collecting a large\\namount of data via numerous sensors in real-time applications [2]. Kevin Ashton initially\\ncoined the IoT concept in 1999 [1,3]. Sensor-based IoT devices can provide various types of\\nservices, such as health, trafﬁc congestion control, robotics, and data analysis, which play\\na signiﬁcant role in daily life assistance [4]. Target tracking is another critical area where\\nthe sensors can be utilized to collect the target real-time position and report it to a server\\nwith its relevant information. The practice of tracking one or multiple targets has vast\\napplications in different research areas, such as object tracking (e.g., player, vehicle) [5–7],\\nborder monitoring to prevent illegal crossing, or battleﬁeld surveillance [8], infrared target\\nrecognition [9,10].\\nIn IoT target-tracking scenarios, tracking single or multiple targets can be realized\\nusing one or more sensors. However, it is impractical to utilize a single sensor for col-\\nlecting the target position information owing to an extended area and will take increased\\ncomputation with low tracking accuracy [ 11]. Therefore, it is pertinent to use multiple\\nsensors, particularly in tracking applications.

Related Work\\nIn recent years, researchers have been working and investing much of their time to\\nsolve the problem of excessive energy consumption in tracking-based applications. Below,\\napplications based on the respective techniques from background studies are presented.\\n2.1. Tracking Application Based on Information-Driven Approaches\\nInformation-driven is a collaborative sensing technique for various target tracking\\napplications, where each deployed sensor is responsible for collaborating with other de-\\nployed sensors to collect moving target information [ 28]. Information-driven methods\\nwere ﬁrst proposed in terms of collaborative sensor selection via the information utility\\nfunction [29]. In this information-driven sensor selection method, the authors considered\\ndifferent Bayesian estimation problems (e.g., entropy and Mahalanobis distance-based util-\\nity measurements) to determine which sensor would track the moving target.Wei et al. [30]\\nproposed a dual-sensor control technique based on the information utility function in a\\nmulti-target tracking application. In this work, the authors used the posterior distance\\nbetween sensor and targets (PDST) function to minimize the distance between sensors\\nand targets, which helped the sensors directly drive the targets. Ping et el. in [ 31] used\\na partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) to select suboptimal sensors for\\ntracking multiple targets. The POMDP sensor selection approach is implemented by maxi-\\nmizing the information gain via a probability hypothesis density (PHD)-based Bayesian\\nframework. Although the techniques proposed in [29–31] illustrated good tracking results,\\nthere is a limitation in choosing an energy-efﬁcient sensor to make their model work in an\\nintelligent manner to reduce the computational complexity.\\n2.2. Machine Learning-Based Techniques for Tracking Application\\nMachine learning is an excellent technique to overcome the computational complexity\\nissue in any complicated engineering problem because it is a self-learner, and it does not\\nneed to be reprogrammed [32–35]. Based on background studies, there are three types of\\nmachine learning approaches (i.e., supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning),\\nwhich have been intelligently utilized for energy optimization. The study of supervised\\nlearning techniques is beyond the scope of this research.'),\n",

Unsupervised Learning-based Clustering Approaches\\nTo address the energy consumption problem, Hosseini and Mirvaziri in [ 36] intro-\\nduced a dynamic K-means clustering-based approach to minimize the target tracking error\\nand energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed technique\\nuses a tube-shaped layering method for the sensor nodes to reduce energy dissipation\\nduring target tracking. In addition, Tengyue et al. [37] employed a clustering algorithm to\\ncontrol the sensor energy, which detected the target in a real-time mobile sensor network.\\nThey used the k-means++ algorithm to separate the sensor nodes into sub-groups. The k-\\nmeans++ separated the sensor nodes, which carried a higher weighted probability for\\ntarget detection, and the remaining unnecessary sensors remained in sleep mode to save\\nenergy consumption. Juan and Hongwei in [ 38] proposed another clustering approach\\nto balance energy in terms of multisensory distributed scheduling. Their work used the\\nenergy-balance technique to control the activation and deactivation modes of communi-\\ncation modules. They employed a multi-hop coordination strategy to decrease energy\\nconsumption. However, these types of unsupervised techniques are time-consuming to\\naddress because of the lack of available prior data labeling [34].\\n2.2.2. Reinforcement Learning Approaches\\nSensor scheduling is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption in many\\ntracking applications. Muhidul et al. in [39] proposed a cooperative RL to schedule the task\\nof each node based on the current tracking environment observation. The proposed method\\nhelped the deployed sensor nodes cooperate by sharing the adjacent node information\\nduring tracking. They applied a weighted reward function that combined both energy\\nconsumption and tracking quality matrices to improve the sensor node task scheduling at\\na particular time. Moreover, transmission scheduling is another necessary task in which\\nDeep RL can be applied. Jiang et al. in [ 40] proposed an approximation technique for\\ntransmitting packets in a scheduling manner for cognitive IoT networks. Their DQN model\\nutilized two parameters (i.e., the power for packet sending via multiple channels and\\npacket dropping) to enhance the system capacity in throughput terms. They used a stacked\\nauto-encoder as a Q-function approximator that mapped the policy to maximize system\\nperformance via a utility-based reward technique. However, they exploited the action\\nusing a comprehensive index evaluation method in a single relay to sync transmission.\\nTo reduce IoT device energy consumption, Mehdi et al. [ 41] employed a Deep RL\\ntechnique to learn an optimal policy for indoor localization problems in IoT-based smart\\ncity services. They deployed a semi-supervised technique to classify unlabeled data and\\nintegrated classiﬁed data with label data. They used iBeacons to provide a received\\nsignal strength indicator (RSSI) as an input for a semi-supervised Deep RL model, which\\nconsists of a variational autoencoder neural network Q-learning technique to enhance\\nindoor localization performance. In [ 27], the authors used two Deep RL methods (e.g.,\\nDQN and DDPG) to adjust the activation area radius so the system can minimize the\\naverage energy consumption in terms of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology-based\\ntracking applications. They also used two action selection strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy\\nand softmax) to determine the activation area radius.\\nThe Deep RL method has not been widely applied for energy saving in IoT target\\ntracking applications, particularly in energy-efﬁcient sensor selection approaches. Intel-\\nligently selecting the appropriate sensor to track the target is challenging because the\\ntarget position varies over time, creating tracking environment uncertainty. In this case,\\nthe DQN-based Deep RL is a sophisticated method because it has the best learning ca-\\npability when interacting with an uncertain dynamic environment. In DQN, selecting a\\nQ-approximator for the tracking environment is vital for obtaining improved learning\\nperformance. Therefore, we utilized the LSTM Q-approximator to predict the suboptimal\\ndecisions (i.e., sensor selection) based on sequential information (i.e., target position) with\\nthe assistance of different gate operations.'),\n",

In this way, we can conserve the energy of the other three\\nsensors. As a result, the overall system capability has improved in a particular subarea.\\n3.4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)\\nThe RL agent is used as a decision-maker to take the best action ( at) from the set\\nof possible actions over the current state ( st). The RL agent does not learn with the\\nlabeled training dataset, but learns from its experience with environmental interaction.\\nDuring environmental interaction at a particular time, the agent receives an immediate\\nreward (rt) and jumps to the next state (st+1). The entire process continues until the agent\\nreaches the ﬁnal state and begins a new episode after resetting the environment.\\nTabular Q-learning (TQL) is a common model-free RL approach that is considered\\nan off-policy algorithm because the Q-function learns from the interactive environment\\nby taking random actions during exploration time [ 48]. Taking action with the help of\\nexploration is essential because initially, the agent has no idea about the new state in\\nan environment; therefore, the agent needs to explore the environment. After acquiring\\nenvironmental experience by exploration, the agent can easily exploit the environment by\\nutilizing the greedy strategy. The exploration and exploitation technique is also called the\\nepsilon-greedy technique [19]. As a result that the TQL is a value-based method, the agent\\nlearning policy is utilized through the value function (Q-value) of state-action pairs. In TQL,\\nthe Q-value Q(st, at) of an individual action of a particular state is stored in a matrix called\\nthe Q-table, which is updated in each time step in (11),\\nQ(st, at) = Q(st−1, at−1) + ∂(rt + γ max(Q(st+1, at+1)) −Q(st−1, at−1)), (11)\\nwhere ∂ and γ ∈[0, 1] represent the learning rate and discount factor, respectively. Note\\nthat, ∂(rt + γ max(Q(st+1, at+1))) denotes as discounted temporal difference (TD) target,\\nwhich gives the maximum Q value of next state in (11). Further, to estimate the TD error\\nduring the training of Q-learning, we subtract the value of TD target from previous Q value\\n(Q(st−1, at−1)). The learning rate is used, which tells how fast the Q-values are updated\\nalong with TD error. Moreover, the discount factor gives stability between immediate\\nand upcoming or future rewards. If the discount factor is near to 1, then the reward will\\nbe more in the future. Otherwise, the system focuses on the immediate reward when\\nthe discount factor is near to 0. However, TQL has difﬁculty in extending the Q-table\\nto a large environment, as it is only appropriate for a small environment. To extend the\\nmethod to a large environment it is necessary for an agent to learn the value function with\\na Q-approximator instead of saving all values into a Q-table.\\n3.5. Deep-Q-Network\\nThe DQN was introduced by Mnih et al. in [ 18] based on the Deep RL method\\nwith the help of a deep neural network, which is known as a Q-approximator. The Q-\\nvalues of different actions are predicted by utilizing the Q-approximator in a particular\\nstate. In DQN, there is a possibility of a signiﬁcant correlation between the data, forming\\nthe Q-approximator instability during the training period. Following this, experience\\nreplay memory and mini-batch techniques are utilized to obtain a stable Q-approximator.\\nExperience replay memory (E) stores the experience (st, at, rt, st+1) in each time step to\\nre-utilize previous experiences multiple times. After storing each experience, the DQN uses\\nthe mini-batch technique to randomly sample data from the experience replay memory to\\nconverge the Q-approximator loss. It can also reduce the correlation between the samples\\nand improve the agent’s learning performance. Moreover, we estimate the predicted and\\ntarget Q-values with two different Q-approximatorsθ and θ′, respectively, to obtain a stable'),\n",

The gates\\nregulate the information ﬂow and can also decide which information should be stored or\\nremoved. The LSTM consists of four gates: forget (Fst), input (Xst), cell (Cst), and output\\n(Ost) states. These four gates store the combined information of the previously hidden\\n(ht−1) and the current input layer (xt) and apply the “sigmoid” operation to all gates\\nexcept the cell state that is ﬁnally activated by “tanh” operation, as shown in Figure 3.\\n𝒉𝒕−𝟏\\n𝒙𝒕\\n𝒄𝒕−𝟏\\n+\\n𝑭𝒔𝒕 𝑿𝒔𝒕 𝑪𝒔𝒕 𝑶𝒔𝒕~ ~~~\\nX\\nX\\n+\\n𝒄𝒕\\n~\\nX\\n𝒉𝒕\\n+Addition Multiply X ~Sigmoid ~tanh\\nFigure 3.

Furthermore, the position\\nof any target is computed using the Kalman ﬁlter. Note that the state has different dis-\\ntance value ranges, which can create instability for the Q-approximator. Therefore, it is\\nnecessary to preprocess the state value by normalization before sending it to the LSTM\\nQ-approximator [25]. We use the mini-max normalization method, which is represented\\nas state normalized (t) = (st−min(st))\\nmax(st)−min(st) to scale the state between 0 and 1 to enhance the state\\nquality before sending it to our proposed LSTM Q-approximator.\\n4.3.

The LSTM-DQN-epsilon-greedy agent\\nselects the best sensor as an action that consumes minimum energy during target tracking.\\nThe energy consumption ( EconSD\\n) of each sensor at time step ( t) is estimated using (14),\\nwhere dSD , powSensor , and ttrack indicate the distance value between a particular sensor\\n(SD) and the target, the working mode sensor power, and time to track the target in a\\nsingle area, respectively. Similarly, we measured the energy consumption for the other\\nN areas. Note that the energy consumption of all sensors is stored in an array as (Econall )\\nin (15). Furthermore, the selected sensor energy consumption ( Econaction ) and minimum\\nenergy consumption (Econmin ) are obtained from (16) and (17). Finally, we estimate the total\\nenergy consumption (Econtotal ) and energy savings in a particular observation using (18)\\nand (19), respectively:\\nEconSD\\n(t) = dSD (t) ×powsensor (t) ×ttrack (t), (14)\\nEconall (t) = EconSD:1∼D\\n(t), (15)\\nEconaction (t) = Econall [ASD ](t), (16)\\nEconmin (t) = min(Econall (t)), (17)\\nEcontotal (t) =\\nD\\n∑\\nSD=1\\nEconSD\\n(t), (18)\\nEsave (t) = Econtotal (t) −Econaction (t).
