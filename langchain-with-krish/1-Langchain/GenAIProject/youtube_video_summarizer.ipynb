       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'cX7L1qwUJfA'}, page_content=\"Bangladesh urges diplomacy over pushin stresses respect for neighborly ties. Government employees continue demonstrations seeking repeal of public service ordinance. Children burned alive as Israel bombs Gaza city school. Assalamu alayikum. This is Afranjum welcoming you all to evening news. You have just heard the crown cement headlines. Now let's move on to the details. Dhaka has consistently lodged strong protests following each reported push-in incident along its border. Emphasizing the importance of diplomatic engagement. Bangladesh maintains that such issues can and should be resolved peacefully. Underscoring the value of regional harmony, acting foreign secretary Muhammad Ruhul Alam Siddhiki today stated that it is appropriate to mistreat a neighboring country, reaffirming Dhaka's commitment to respectful and constructive bilateral relations. Diplomatic The Bangladesh Army today reiterated its unwavering dedication to safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and standing in solidarity with the people. Speaking at a press briefing held at the officer's mess in Taka canlement, Colonel Muhammad Shafikul Islam emphasized that the army will take firm measures against any actions that threaten public safety including loss of life, destruction of property, mob violence or disruptions that cause public distress. Amid the current national circumstances, Colonel Islam highlighted that the Bangladesh Army continues to work diligently to uphold national security, protect citizens and their property, and secure critical state infrastructure, ensuring stability throughout the country. Government officials and employees held their demonstration for the third consecutive day at the secretary at demanding the withdrawal of the public service amendment ordinance which allows easier dismissal of employees for misconduct. The protesters resumed their protest inside the secretariat earlier this morning. The main gate of the secretariat was locked when the protesters took position there at around 12:30 p.m. The gate was reopened 30 minutes later while the protests continued inside the country's administrative hub, disrupting the regular workflow. Meanwhile, additional police personnel were deployed at the secretariat this morning to tackle any unto situation. The protesting employees said the ordinance has created opportunities to punish or even dismiss government officials more easily, raising concerns over its potential misuse. Warning the protesters at the secretariat and the NBR, NCP leader Hassnat Abdullah stated that anyone attempting to obstruct the reform process, they would be firmly resisted with the support of the people. Hastnat made the remarks at a gathering in front of Biplop Udan at Scholola Shanogore in Chram City at the beginning of NCP's organization nal visit to the district. Hashnat also said before 5th August those protesters didn't dare to question Shik Hassina. Venting anger, the NCP leader also said when children and ordinary citizens of the country were being shot and killed in the streets, a single secretary, bureaucrat or government official did not resign. Meanwhile, Hnad Abdullah requested if the bureaucrats have any objections to the government's reform process, they should resolve it through discussion. The leaders and activists of BNP and the supporters of Ishra Hussein have been holding sitting program for the 12th consecutive day in front of the Ngur Pabun demanding Ishra's swear in as Dhaka South mayor. The protesters have staged sitin in in front of the Ngor Pabon since morning and have been chanting various slogans in favor of Ishraq. Meanwhile, the civic services of the DSCC have come to a halt due to the non ongoing movement. The protesters said Ishra's oath taking should be organized immediately otherwise the locks of the Ngor Pabun will not be reopened. The protesters all have also warned a tough movement if Ishra is not sworn in within next 24 hours. However, a leave to appeal has been filed with the appallet division seeking a stay on the electoral tribunal's verdict and the election commission's gazit that declared BNP leader Ishra Hussein as mayor of Dhaka's south city corporation. The application was submitted today to the relevant branch of the Supreme Court's Appalate Division. The assistant teachers of government primary schools are observing a full day strike across the country to press home their three-point demands, including fixing their starting salary to the 11th grade of the national pay scale. As a result of this strike program, the educational activities of students across the country are being disrupted. Their other demands are resolving complications regarding higher grade eligibility after 10 years and 16 years of service and 100% promotion to the post of the head teachers. The leaders of the primary school assistant teachers association said they will continue until the demands are met. The leaders and activists of Bangladesh Jatyabadi Chhatradoll of Taka University unit held a sitting program in front of vice chancellor's office demanding justice of the murder of Shahier Alum Shamo and the resignation of the university's vice chancellor and proctor. The JCD leaders started their program from the morning of the day. The leaders complained the university administration has been neglecting to ensure justice for Shammo murder case from the beginning. The leaders also alleged the administration has failed to ensure security in the university area. At this time, JCD leaders demanded the immediate resignation of the vice chancellor and proctor taking responsibility for the murder of Shamu. Meanwhile, the investigation committee formed to probe the death of Shamo submitted its final report to the vice chancellor, Professor Nyaz Ahmed Khan today. The convenor of the probe committee, Professor Mohammed Siddiqur Rahman Khan formally handed over the report. Before ending, let's have a look on the crown cement headlines once again. Bangladesh urges diplomacy over pushin stresses respect for neighborly ties. Government employees continue demonstrations seeking repeal of public service ordinance.
